Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts students’ final academic scores using a supervised machine learning regression model.
It analyzes academic and behavioral attributes such as study hours, attendance, and internal marks.

🎯 Problem Statement

To predict a student’s final exam score based on:

Study Hours

Attendance Percentage

Internal Assessment Marks

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Learning Type: Supervised Learning

Problem Type: Regression

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression

🧰 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

IDE: VS Code

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

Feature Name	Description
StudyHours	Number of hours studied per day
Attendance	Attendance percentage
InternalMarks	Internal assessment marks
FinalScore	Final exam score (target variable)
🔁 Project Workflow

Data collection and preprocessing

Feature selection

Train-test split
